# OOP w/ PHP

💊 In this pill I learnt the basics of OOP with PHP. I find this is very cool and interesting, ir definetly adds a lot of code but I feel its more scalable 
and easier to understand in the end. 

For this pill I used the idea of mobile phones so you create new phones with its brand and their methods. 

𐃄 Tools Used
